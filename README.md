# About this repository
This is a public repository providing an example of basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). After loading a dataset, EDA is often the next steps of data analysis. The basic idea of EDA is to quickly analyse and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. As defined by IBM, EDA helps "data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions."[EDA]
