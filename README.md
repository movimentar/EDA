# About this repository
This is a public repository providing an example of basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). After loading a dataset, EDA is often the next steps of data analysis. The basic idea of EDA is to quickly analyse and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. As presented by IBM, EDA helps 

> "data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or > > hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical > > techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. "[^EDA]
